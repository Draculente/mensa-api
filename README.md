This project is a web scraper that scans the canteen website of the University of LÃ¼beck and extracts information about the menu. It provides access to the current menus and their details, such as names, prices and vegetarian options.

## API

Since the first version of this scraper was written in Typescript and therefore used an exorbitant amount of memory when running, I rewrote it in Rust.  
I also took the opportunity to improve the design of the REST API. The documentation of the new API v2 is available [here](https://github.com/Draculente/mensa-api/blob/main/openapi.yaml).  

### Arrays

The API allows many query parameters to have multiple values (like arrays). Just separate the values with commas.

#### Example

```bash
curl https://speiseplan.mcloud.digital/v2/meals?location=HL_ME,HL_MH | jq
```

## Configuration

The app is configured via environment variables. The following variables are available:

| Name                  | Description                                                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PORT`                | The port the app will listen on. Defaults to `3030`.                                                   |
| `TTL`      | The time to live of the menu cache containing the meals in seconds. Defaults to `60 * 45`. |

## Local Setup

### Requirements

- Rust

### Run

```bash
cargo run
```

Per default the app will run on port 3030. You can change this by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on a kubernetes cluster. To deploy a new version, just push to the main branch. The cluster will
automatically pull the latest version and restart the app.

The app is available at https://speiseplan.mcloud.digital/v2 .

## Gitmoji

This project uses [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) to make commits more expressive.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g gitmoji-cli
```

### Initialize as git hook

```bash
gitmoji -i
```
